## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |

| Css | H |  4hrs |     |     |
| Total | H | 24hrs|  |  |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Api fetching and rendering data via axios, Airtable usage

### Weaknesses: Need more experience understanding and working with React as a whole

### Opportunities: Having the oppurtunity of  mapping out a very detailed plan (wireframes, component hirarchy, timeline), Access to previous lectures and supportive team for guidance

### Threats:  Time management, React app building
